Add the vanilla.</li><li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li><li>Alternate adding the flour mixture and milk to the butter mixture, starting and ending with the flour mixture.

Sprinkle or brush a small amount of the soak over each cupcake, and allow it to soak in.</li><li> To make the frosting: Beat the whipping cream until medium peaks form.</li><li> Whisk together the confectioners' sugar and ClearJel, and slowly add to the whipped cream along with the Amaretto.
</li><li> Gently and briefly whisk in the mascarpone cheese by hand until the frosting is thick and creamy (this shouldn't take more than 4 or 5 passes with the whisk); more than that and the frosting will get grainy.</li><li> Pipe the frosting over the cupcakes, then dust with cocoa. Chill until ready to serve.</li>
